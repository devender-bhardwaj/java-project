## Java project on restarant Mangement

## What it does
This is a java project for restaurant management <br>

## You can log in as cusomter or owner 

## As owner you can
- See menu
- See all customers
- Add customers
## As customer you can
- See menu
- Select food items and their quantity
- Pay bill
 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder to main dependencies

## Shortcomings 
I haven't figured out how to add database to github,
Once I learn this database files will be added in lib folder. <br>
For now you can create database in system named `restaurant` <br>
`restaurant` contains 2 tables `menu` and `customer`

### `menu`
#### `Description`
![description of table menu]("database description\menudesc.jpg")

#### `Content`
![content in table menu]("database description\menucon.jpg")

### `customer`
#### `Description`
![description of table customer]("database description\custdesc.jpg")

#### `Content`
![content in table customer]("database description\custcon.jpg")
